# Just for fun
This is just a Project to test out some stuff in Node.js.
There is no special purpose for the code, just some experiments. But
some useful lines might be there as well ;)

## Foundation
Most of the examples and inspiration is drawn from the book "Node.js in
Action" published by Manning Publications.
